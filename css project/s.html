		<h1>What Is Responsive Web Design?</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, 
				platform and orientation.
				The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.
				As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.
				One may also have to consider the settings on their devices; if they have a VPN for iOS on their iPad, for example, 
				the website should not block the user’s access to the page. 
				In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. 
				This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.
				Almost every new client these days wants a mobile version of their website. It’s practically essential after all:
				one design for the BlackBerry, another for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen resolutions must be compatible, too. 
				In the next five years, we’ll likely need to design for a number of additional inventions. When will the madness stop? It won’t, of course.
				Transplant this discipline onto Web design, and we have a similar yet whole new idea. 
				Why should we create a custom Web design for each group of users; after all, architects don’t design a building for each group size and type that passes through it? 
				Like responsive architecture, Web design should automatically adjust. It shouldn’t require countless custom-made solutions for each new category of users.
				Obviously, we can’t use motion sensors and robotics to accomplish this the way a building would. Responsive Web design requires a more abstract way of thinking. 
				However, some ideas are already being practiced: fluid layouts, media queries and scripts that can reformat Web pages and mark-up effortlessly (or automatically).
				With more devices come varying screen resolutions, definitions and orientations. 
				New devices with new screen sizes are being developed every day, and each of these devices may be able to handle variations in size, functionality and even color. 
				Some are in landscape, others in portrait, still others even completely square. 
				As we know from the rising popularity of the iPhone, iPad and advanced smartphones, many new devices are able to switch from portrait to landscape at the user’s whim. 
				How is one to design for these situations?

			<p class="demo">As long as no other width-based image styles override this rule,
				every image will load in its original size, unless the viewing area becomes narrower than the image’s original width. 
				The maximum width of the image is set to 100% of the screen or browser width, so when that 100% becomes narrower, so does the image. Essentially, as Jason Grigsby noted, 
				“The idea behind fluid images is that you deliver images at the maximum size they will be used at. 
				You don’t declare the height and width in your code, but instead let the browser resize the images as needed while using CSS to guide their relative size”. 
				It’s a great and simple technique to resize images beautifully.
				Note that max-width is not supported in IE, but a good use of width: 100% would solve the problem neatly in an IE-specific style sheet. 
				One more issue is that when an image is resized too small in some older browsers in Windows, the rendering isn’t as clear as it ought to be. 
				There is a JavaScript to fix this issue, though, found in Ethan Marcotte’s article.
				Above, the h1 element holds the illustration as a background, and the image is aligned according to the container’s background (the heading).
				This is just one example of the kind of thinking that makes responsive Web design truly effective.
